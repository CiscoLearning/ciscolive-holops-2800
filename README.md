# LTRCRT-2000

## Steps Prior to Starting the Lab

1.  Install the remote extension pack for Visual Studio Code (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack>)
2.  Connect to the remote developer@10.10.20.50
3.  Open a Terminal in VSCode (which should be on the Devbox)
4.  Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CiscoLearning/ciscolive-ltrcrt-2000
```

## Starting the Lab

To prepare the lab environment, call the `start` script with the desired lab from a Terminal pane within VSCode. e.g.:

```sh
sh start
```

Then, change directory to `~/ciscolive-ltrcrt-2000` and run `code -a .` to open that directory within the VSCode window.
